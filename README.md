# eur-to-brl

`eur-to-brl` is a command-line (CLI) tool designed to assist users in converting Euro (EUR) amounts to Brazilian Real (BRL) using official exchange rates provided by the [Brazilain Central Bank](https://www.bcb.gov.br/en) and the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu). The tool is particularly tailored for individuals and businesses preparing income reports in compliance with tax regulations defined by the [Brazilian Federal Revenue Service](https://www.gov.br/receitafederal/).

## Features

- Convert multiple transactions listed in a CSV file.
- Perform single-amount conversions for specific dates.
- Tailored for income and tax payment reporting requirements.

## Conversion rules

The tool applies a two-step process to convert amounts from EUR to BRL, following the rules below:

1. **EUR to USD Conversion**

   - The Euro amount is first converted to USD using the exchange rate provided by the European Central Bank for the specified event date.

2. **USD to BRL Conversion**

   - The USD amount is then converted to BRL using the bid rate published by the Brazilian Central Bank.

   - The exchange rate used corresponds to the last business day of the first half of the month before the specified event date.

**Example:** For an event on **April 15, 2023**:

- The **EUR to USD** conversion uses the European Central Bank's rate for **April 15, 2023**.

- The **USD to BRL** conversion uses the Brazilian Central Bank's bid rate for **March 15, 2023** (last business day of the first half of March).

## Usage
